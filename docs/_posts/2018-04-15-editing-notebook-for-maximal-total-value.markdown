# Started with Simple Intentions

I recently started a technical project by exploring some imported data using _pandas_, a data science tool, in a Jupyter notebook. This allows data, code, and prose to coexist in the same document, which is great for documenting the techniques and processes of one's data analysis work. After many hours, I developed a document that shows my work from beginning to end, with examples based on real spreadsheet files.

The initial purpose of the notebook was to rapidly construct a workspace from which probe the data using _pandas_, and the highest priority was producing usable output in the form of more spreadsheet files.


# Beneficial Side Effects of Doing Work in Jupyter Notebooks

As a side effect of documenting the process along the way, with examples and sources, I developed a valuable instructive document. Another person could, with a certain level of preparedness, comprehend the document and repeat my analytical steps with great accuracy.


# Downsides of Writing for Multiple Audiences

Unfortunately, because educating others wasn't on my mind during the early stages of the analysis, there are numerous issues with this document as a piece of instructional writing. While writing it with only the end results in mind, I'd left out explanations that I take for granted.

To serve as more than the personal notebook of work done, the notebook must be revised with an editor's perspective. Specifically, an audience must be identified and targeted.

* If the audience is myself, I should explain only the newly learned knowledge, such as the analytical results of the project data.
* If the audience will be interacting with the notebook in Jupyter, I should introduce the audience to the ways they can do that, and sources of additional learning about Jupyter.
* If the audience is someone who has never programmed before, I should explain rudimentary Python concepts wherever they aren't obvious from the code shown in the document.
* If the audience is someone who has never worked with data in scientific research tools such as _pandas_, I should explain the basic concepts surrounding collections of indexed data.
* If the audience is someone who is familiar with a different set of tools, such as the _R_ language, RStudio, and Shiny, I should learn the differences and offer comparisons and notes about the differences.
* If I don't know enough about my audience, I should write for all of the most likely cases.

Once I realized this dilemma, I started including more explanations and
links to other documents. Subsequently, the document has grown
considerably, and lost some of its original focus.

I'm mostly done with the analysis of the source file, and need only
write a few more paragraphs to conclude the written portion of this
project, if results are the only required outcome.


# Upsides of Editing for Multiple Audiences

Unlike writing for multiple audiences, editing can be done from a
foundation of text and base revisions upon that common starting point.
If editing in a certain direction reveals gaps in the text, it becomes
obvious that more writing will be required. If an attempt to edit the
text for a certain purpose is unsuccessful, the original basis of the
revision can simply live on without the unnecessary, unfinished
portions.

Once I realized that writing for multiple audiences is something that
detracts from my focus on usable data output, I tried to stop writing
entirely, and decide whether it would be better to split the document
apart, into a generally instructional document and a project report,
or to maintain it as a single document.

I decided to print out the notebook and proofread it on paper, with ink
in hand to mark it for corrections. If the document would require too
much work to be useful as an educational piece, I would split it apart.
If it would need little refinement, I would do the edits and then finish
the analysis, preserving the format and style.

Now that I've done the edit on paper, I can see that most of the
document was written while I was learning about _pandas_ and checking my
understanding at each step along the way. My brief explanations of
Python data structures was relevant, but needed to be repositioned in
the flow of the overall document. This is a good learning resource, for
people who have not programmed, not used Jupyter, and who may or may not
reproduce my results.

# Next Step

Now I can approach the final section of the document as a focused
writer, because I know my audience. I expect to get good results in the
writing as well as the analysis. I won't be hesitating each time I begin
a paragraph or code block.
